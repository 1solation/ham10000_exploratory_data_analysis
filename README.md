# Exploratory data analysis on the HAM10000 dataset

This work is part of my final year project for my BSc (Hons) Software Engineering project. In this repo there is a jupyter notebook where I explored the various different features of the dataset, and plotted graphs/figures using matplotlib to visualise the results.

The dataset is publicly available to downlaod over at [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T).
